Develop a SMS-based service which provides a walkthrough for people in need of medical care.
 It’s for people who don’t have easy access to medical care who may live in rural areas. 
The messages provide instruction on what to do in the first few minutes of an injury, which is often considered the most critical time. 
Simple responses about what type of injury or condition a person has trigger a treatment plan that comes up without repeated clicks.


We are providing bot sms facility. So it doesn’t need any internet, with low signal we can do it.
We will provide a step by step clear instruction in the language which they chose till the ambulance arrive.
